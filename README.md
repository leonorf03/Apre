# Deep Learning Homework Project

This repository contains solutions and implementations for deep learning assignments. It includes two homework assignments that cover various aspects of deep learning, including matrix operations, neural network training, and attention mechanisms.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`hw1/`**: Contains code and resources for the first homework assignment.
- **`hw2/`**: Contains code and resources for the second homework assignment.

## Homework Assignments

### Homework 1

The first homework focuses on:
- Implementing and training simple deep learning models.
- Working with data preprocessing and evaluation metrics.
- Generating and analyzing results.

### Homework 2

The second homework delves into:
- Attention mechanisms, including scaled dot-product attention and Bahdanau attention.
- Implementing encoders, decoders, and sequence-to-sequence models.
- Training and evaluating models with character-level metrics like CER and WER.

## Requirements

To run the code, you will need the following libraries:

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Any other specific dependencies for each homework (listed in their respective folders).
